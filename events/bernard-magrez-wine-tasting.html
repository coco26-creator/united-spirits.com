    <!-- DETAILED DESCRIPTION -->
    <div class="mt-16 prose lg:prose-xl max-w-none">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-gray-900 mb-4">Event Overview</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
        This hands-on masterclass provided participants with expert guidance on the principles of successful wine and food pairing through demonstrations and guided tastings. Led by a Michelin-starred chef and a certified sommelier, the session focused on how to balance acidity, tannins, and flavor intensity when matching wines with different cuisines, with special emphasis on Asian dishes. The event was designed for both culinary professionals and wine enthusiasts seeking to elevate their dining experiences through thoughtful pairings.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">Key Highlights</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
        The masterclass featured live cooking demonstrations where the chef prepared six carefully curated dishes, each representing a different Asian cuisine style. The sommelier presented corresponding wine pairings, explaining the rationale behind each selection and demonstrating how specific wine characteristics complement or contrast with food elements. Participants engaged in a comparative tasting of each pairing, learning to identify how different combinations affect the perception of both the food and the wine. The session included special attention to pairing wines with challenging Asian ingredients like chili, ginger, and fermented sauces, which often present unique challenges for wine pairing.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">Featured Pairings</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
        The session showcased six expertly curated pairings, including:
      </p>
      <ul class="text-lg text-gray-700 pl-6 list-disc space-y-2">
        <li>Anderra Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon 2023 with slow-braised beef short ribs - Demonstrating how tannins cut through rich meats</li>
        <li>Bernard Magrez Le Symbole 2020 with truffle-infused mushroom risotto - Showcasing earthy wine and food harmony</li>
        <li>Chateau Cabannieux 2019 with steamed sea bass and ginger - Highlighting how acidity balances delicate flavors</li>
        <li>Corazón de Lolita Premium Coupage with Szechuan-spiced eggplant - Illustrating how fruit-forward wines tame spice</li>
        <li>Lolita RTD Red Wine Cans with dim sum assortment - Modern approach to traditional pairings</li>
        <li>Honney Conti XO with dark chocolate dessert - Classic pairing with a premium twist</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">Learning Outcomes</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
        Participants gained practical knowledge they could immediately apply to their personal or professional dining experiences. They learned the four fundamental principles of wine and food pairing: matching intensity, balancing flavors, complementary characteristics, and contrasting elements. The session provided specific guidance for pairing wines with common Asian ingredients that are traditionally challenging, such as how to select wines that complement rather than clash with spicy, sour, or umami-rich dishes. Attendees received a comprehensive pairing guide with cheat sheets for common Asian dishes and wine recommendations. The event concluded with a hands-on exercise where participants created their own pairings under the guidance of the experts, solidifying their understanding of the principles covered.
